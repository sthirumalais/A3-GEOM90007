The male has a slate-blue bill which changes to bright-blue during the breeding season, hence the duck's common name. The male has deep chestnut plumage during breeding season, reverting to a dark grey. The female retains black plumage with brown tips all year round. The duck is endemic to Australia's temperate regions, inhabiting natural inland wetlands and also artificial wetlands, such as sewage ponds, in large numbers. It can be difficult to observe due to its cryptic nature during its breeding season through autumn and winter. The male duck exhibits a complex mating ritual. The blue-billed duck is omnivorous, with a preference for small aquatic invertebrates. BirdLife International has classified this species as Least concern. Major threats include drainage of deep permanent wetlands, or their degradation as a result of introduced fish, peripheral cattle grazing, salinization, and lowering of ground water.","https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Oxyura_australis_male_2_-_Penrith.jpg/330px-Oxyura_australis_male_2_-_Penrith.jpg","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue-billed_duck","CC BY-SA 4.0 (Wikipedia/Wikimedia Commons)","available"

"Hydroprogne caspia","Caspian tern","The Caspian tern is the world's largest species of tern, with a subcosmopolitan but scattered distribution. Despite its extensive range, it is monotypic of its genus, and has no accepted subspecies. The genus name is from Ancient Greek hudro-, ""water-"", and Latin progne, ""swallow"". The specific caspia is from Latin and, like the English name, refers to the Caspian Sea.","https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Sterna-caspia-010.jpg/330px-Sterna-caspia-010.jpg","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspian_tern","CC BY-SA 4.0 (Wikipedia/Wikimedia Commons)","available"
"Biziura lobata","Musk duck","The musk duck is a highly aquatic, stiff-tailed duck native to southern Australia. It is the only living member of the genus Biziura. An extinct relative, the New Zealand musk duck or de Lautour's duck, once occurred on New Zealand, but is only known from prehistoric subfossil bones. It was about 8% longer than the living species, with a particularly large head.","https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Musk_Duck_%2821128221230%29.jpg/330px-Musk_Duck_%2821128221230%29.jpg","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musk_duck","CC BY-SA 4.0 (Wikipedia/Wikimedia Commons)","available"
"Chalcites osculans","Black-eared cuckoo","The black-eared cuckoo is a species of cuckoo in the family Cuculidae.
Found across Australia, it migrates to eastern Indonesia and southern New Guinea. They are usually observed by themselves or in a pair as they don't raise their own young, rather they leave eggs in another species nest to be raised by host. This species was formerly placed in the genus Chrysococcyx.","https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Chrysococcyx_osculans_-_Glen_Davis.jpg/330px-Chrysococcyx_osculans_-_Glen_Davis.jpg","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-eared_cuckoo","CC BY-SA 4.0 (Wikipedia/Wikimedia Commons)","available"
"Anseranas semipalmata","Magpie goose","The magpie goose is the sole living representative species of the family Anseranatidae. This common waterbird is found in northern Australia and southern New Guinea. As the species is prone to wandering, especially when not breeding, it is sometimes recorded outside its core range. The species was once also widespread in southern Australia but disappeared from there largely due to the drainage of the wetlands where the birds once bred. Due to their importance to Aboriginal people as a seasonal food source, as subjects of recreational hunting, and as a tourist attraction, their expansive and stable presence in northern Australia has been ""ensured [by] protective management"".","https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/Magpie_Goose_-_East_Point.jpg/330px-Magpie_Goose_-_East_Point.jpg","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magpie_goose","CC BY-SA 4.0 (Wikipedia/Wikimedia Commons)","available"
